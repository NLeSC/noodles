    "# Real World Tutorial 3: Parallel Number crunching using Cython\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was not designed to be very good at parallel processing. There are two major problems at the core of the language that make it hard to implement parallel algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Global Interpreter Lock\n",
    "* Flexible object model\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these issues is the most famous obstacle towards a convincing multi-threading approach, where a single instance of the Python interpreter runs in several threads. The second point is more subtle, but makes it harder to do multi-processing, where several independent instances of the Python interpreter work together to achieve parallelism. We will first explain an elegant way to work around the Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL: use Cython.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Cython to lift the GIL\n",
    "The GIL means that the Python interpreter will only operate on one thread at a time. Even when we think we run in a gazillion threads, Python itself uses only one. Multi-threading in Python is only usefull to wait for I/O and to perform system calls. To do useful CPU intensive work in multi-threaded mode, we need to develop functions that are implemented in C, and tell Python when we call these functions not to worry about the GIL. The easiest way to achieve this, is to use Cython. We develop a number-crunching prime adder, and have it run in parallel threads. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll load the ``multiprocessing``, ``threading`` and ``queue`` modules to do our plumbing, and the ``cython`` extension so we can do the number crunching, as is shown in [this blog post](https://lbolla.info/blog/2013/12/23/python-threads-cython-gil)."
